When I'm dealing with the math/calculous painfully today, my mailwoman(classmate) give me a package. Thanks for this disruption, I left the math far away. :)<p>

It's a book from hoowa, one of the <a href='http://www.perlchina.org'>PerlChina</a> leaders. It's a prize for my translation work on Perl localization. u can find them here: <a href='http://wiki.perlchina.org/main/'>http://wiki.perlchina.org/main/</a>.<p>

The book is < Network Programming with Perl >, by the CGI.pm author -- Lincoin D.Stein.<br>
I read it once years ago and it's still worth reading again. Thanks for hoowa & PerlChina.<p>
