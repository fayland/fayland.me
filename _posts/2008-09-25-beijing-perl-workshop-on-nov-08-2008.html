It is jointly organized with the postgresql china that means there will be some postgresql talks as well. We have also secured few sponsorships to fly Jesse Vincent and two other postgresql hackers to the workshop.<br /><br />If you are planning a trip to beijing in the early November, send a email to conference[at]perlchina.org to register the workshop, or even better come give a talk(20,40 minutes or lighting talk)!<br /><br />From <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Qiang/journal/37527">http://use.perl.org/~Qiang/journal/37527</a><br /><br />==============<br /><br />I'm not sure if I can go there, but I want to!
