<p>Perl6 is not so popular in China as I expected. and I think Perl5 will not die within ten years + Perl6 still need 1~2 years to grow up.</p>

<p>I attended a project named "Perl6 localization"(<a href='http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/?Queue=279'>p6l10n</a>). It translate the <a href='http://dev.perl.org/perl6/synopsis/'>Perl6|Synopsis</a> into Chinese.<br />
sounds great, but I should blame myself for being so lazy && patience-less. I haven't make any further step in last few months.
</p>

<p>I'm always like that. Full of enthusiasm at beginning and my passion lostes when time passes.<br />
I'm always regretful for this. </p>

<p>Now I pick up the <a href='http://www.fayland.org/Perl6/Synopsis/zh_cn/'>translation</a> of <a href='http://www.fayland.org/Perl6/Synopsis/en'>Synopsis</a>.<br />
God bless me.</p>
