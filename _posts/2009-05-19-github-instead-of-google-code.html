yes. I do love <a href="http://github.com/fayland">github</a> more than <a href="http://code.google.com/u/fayland/">google code</a>. it's not the problem of git or svn. svn is fine.<br /><br />the point is participation.<br />In google code, it's very hard to contribute some code to one project if you're not the author. it disappoints me a lot.<br />The "fork" button in github is very helpful. people forked my repos then pull requests to ask me to merge (like perl-net-github, dist-zilla-plugin-repository). I forked someone's repos then pull back (like theschwartz-moosified, dist-zilla, git-pureperl etc).<br /><br />it's awesome. go start using github right now. :)
