I have written another Catalyst module to pick up desired components for Catalyst App.<br /><br /><a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::PickComponents'>Catalyst::Plugin::PickComponents</a><br /><br />When I develop Foorum, I find the Controller/Model pm are expanding quickly. and it's not good for mod_perl since it will load all modules into the process. it costs memories.<br /><br />that's why I wrote this. to reduce memory usage of mod_perl.<br /><br />Thanks.
