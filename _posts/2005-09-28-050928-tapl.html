When I surf the "Announcement of Newest Books" of the School Library today, I find the "<a href='http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/'>Types and Programming Languages</a>" （《类型和程序设计语言》）written by Benjamin C. Pierce, translated by 马世龙 & 睦跃飞 etc. and published by "Publishing House of Electronics Industry"（电子工业出版社）。<p />If you are interested in <a href="http://www.pugscode.org">Pugs</a>, u should know that Autrijus Tang suggests this book in "<a href='http://svn.perl.org/perl6/pugs/trunk/docs/01Overview.html'>Pugs Apocryphon 1<br />Overview of the Pugs project</a>. Quoted as follows:<br /><pre>Where can I learn more about implementing programming languages?<p /><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Ebcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a> is an essential read; Pugs started out as a self-initiated study of the text, and it continues to be an important guide during the implementation. Its sequel, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Ebcpierce/attapl/">Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages</a>, is also invaluable. It may also help to get acquainted with other multi-paradigmatic languages, such as <a href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/">Mozart/Oz</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/%7Emh/curry/">Curry</a> and <a href="http://www.ocaml.org/">O’Caml</a>. Finally, the detailed <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/%7Echak/haskell/ghc/comm/">GHC commentary</a> describes how GHC itself was implemented.</pre>But when I start to read it, I must admit that it's too difficult to understand, especially for an advertisement student.<br />I realise that my computer knowledge is so limited. It's just another world, different with what I know but worth learning.<br />Now design a language is in my TODO list. Though it's hard, I'll repick this book one day.<h3>update</h3>u can buy it from <a href="http://www.china-pub.com/computers/common/info.asp?id=24942">http://www.china-pub.com/computers/common/info.asp?id=24942</a>
