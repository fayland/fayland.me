<p>yesterday morning I complained to joe that I was so hurry up to catch the train that forgot to take an ubuntu CD in the Shanghai PM meeting. Yet interesting, I received a package from Holland that contains 10 ubuntu CDs at afternoon.</p>

<p>Thank God, so I installed the ubuntu immediately. The process of installation is easy except the Networking Checking, it took too long (Maybe it concerns that I'm in the intranet and not internet-available without login-in).</p>

<p>I'm a newbie of linux. only know something about man,chmod,cp,ls etc. Thanks cnhackTNT, he helps me with the root-login and suggested a great site <a href='http://www.ubuntu.org.cn'>http://www.ubuntu.org.cn</a>. I followed the instruction, and now I can type Chinese, LumaQQ, and the Apache is running. So does my Eplanet. :)</p>

<p>I svn checkout pugs, p6l10n, catalyst, and miniCPAN. pugs/parrot can -v now. :)<br />
now I can do everything I want in ubuntu.</p>

<p>as a newcomer, I also met some problems such as after 'mount /dev/hda6 /mnt/e', some of my directory/files is lowercase(the original source is uppercase. I thought that I missed some important switches. :)<br />
Any way, I'm learning linux now. and utunbu rocks.</p>

<p>It's a journal from ubuntu. Thank God.</p>

Update: sorry, I made a mistake of the guy is cnhackTNT, not cnTNThack. :)
