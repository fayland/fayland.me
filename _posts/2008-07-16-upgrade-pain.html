Recently I upgrade subversion to 1.5.0 on my WinXP box. but GOD, that's not working with svn+ssh at all. It's too painful to point out the plink is not working in svn 1.5.0 as before. <br /><br /><a href="http://sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx</a> 0.9.8 is out. but I think I would upgrade it after 1 week or more.<br /><br />upgrade is painful.<br /><br />Thanks.
