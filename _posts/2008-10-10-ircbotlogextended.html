well, I do NOT want to miss the irc talk history when I go sleep. I want to store the talk into plain text, and read it when I'm free.<br /><br />that's a simple and straight. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IRC::Bot">IRC::Bot</a> is good. really fast and have a logger built-in.<br />The only thing I don't like IRC::Bot is that it stores all talk history into one file channel.log regardless channel and day. I want to split them, to ease the reading.<br /><br />so that's why <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IRC::Bot::Log::Extended">IRC::Bot::Log::Extended</a> is kicked out.<br />and the example script is <a href="http://fayland.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/script/web/irclog.pl">http://fayland.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/script/web/irclog.pl</a><br /><br />so it's logging for me. all #catalyst #dbix-class #tt #moose talk history.<br /><br />Thanks.
