Sometimes you got a pfx file (with password pharse) that you can import it into Firefox certificates to view the website.

in Perl, it's a bit different, you first need use *openssl* to convert it into cert pem files.

    openssl pkcs12 -in test.pfx -out mycert.pem -nodes
    openssl rsa -in mycert.pem -out mycertkey.pem

with that, you got two files. then with LWP::UserAgent or any other modules based on it:

    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(
        ssl_opts => {
            SSL_use_cert => 1,
            verify_hostname => 0,
            SSL_cert_file => "$Bin/mycert.pem",
            SSL_key_file => "$Bin/mycertkey.pem",
        }
    )
    my $res = $ua->get("https://blabla.com/");

you can always use below to debug SSL:

    use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug4);

and if the pfx is for SOAP::Lite, you can use something like below:

    $soap->transport->ssl_opts(
        SSL_use_cert => 1,
        verify_hostname => 0,
        SSL_cert_file => "$Bin/mycert.pem",
        SSL_key_file => "$Bin/mycertkey.pem",
    );

basically *transport* is LWP::UserAgent based on http(s) SOAP url.

Have fun.
