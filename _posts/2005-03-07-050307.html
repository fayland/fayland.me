I heard from hoowa that the TaiWanese perlmonks would launch the translation work of 'Perl 6 Synopsis'. That's great and I want to join them.<p>

But it's out of luck today. After missing Autrijus Tang two times, I caught him at the irc.freenode.com #perl6 finally. He welcomed me and asked hcchien to send me a invitation email so that I can use 'svn commit' to add/update the document.<p>

The 'p6l10n' project's website: <a href='http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/?Queue=279'>http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/?Queue=279</a><br>
The <a href='http://subversion.tigris.org/'>Subversion/svn</a>: <a href='http://svn.openfoundry.org/p6l10n/'>http://svn.openfoundry.org/p6l10n/</a><p>

I find it's difficult for me to do all myself. Lucky, I'll do my translation work based on the work of zh_tw. Maybe I'll use Office/Word to convert Trad.Chinese to Simp.Chinese and correct the glossary/term difference. That's easy.<p>

Another way, I'll do the translation work by myself, word by word. Of course, the ever done of translation by TaiWanese are excellent reference.<p>

I'm not sure which will be selected. It's decided by how busy I am.<p>

God bless all move smooth.
