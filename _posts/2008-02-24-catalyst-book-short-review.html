title: Catalyst Book Short Review

{% include JB/setup %}

Yup, my boss brought this Catalyst book for me. I spent one day to read through this book.<br /><br />Frankly, it's too short. less than 200 pages. and some are already known stuff.<br />but it does inspire me at some point. and I'm pretty happy with it (esp. the model stuff)<br /><br />well, I'm not going to blame the author, but it's not good enough. I thought there should be some knowledge about DBIx::Class and TT2, but it's too less. and it talks too less plugins. I know he can't cover all, but I think he should talk some useful plugins like Cache.<br /><br />All can be in one sentence. it's too short. He should write 600 pages at least. Catalyst is worth 600 pages at least. :)<br /><br />Any way, it's still a good book. I'm hoping the next Catalyst book.
