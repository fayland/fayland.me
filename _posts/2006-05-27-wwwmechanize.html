I should suggest u guys all to have a try of <a href='http://search.cpan.org/~petdance/WWW-Mechanize-1.18/lib/WWW/Mechanize.pm'>WWW::Mechanize</a><br />WWW::Mechanize is damn useful. I use it to fecth all contacts information from mail suppliers such as Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, 163, Sina, Sohu and Tom.<br />ya, many thanks for petdance, it works great! (though all the supplier are using javascript a lot, a pity that WWW::Mechanize don't support javascript)<br /><br />and TT2 ++, a new version of 2.15 is released. TT is my lovest template system ever.<br /><a href='http://search.cpan.org/src/ABW/Template-Toolkit-2.15/Changes'>http://search.cpan.org/src/ABW/Template-Toolkit-2.15/Changes</a>
