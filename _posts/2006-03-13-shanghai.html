Hi, I'm at Shanghai now, in the East Asia Hotel at NanJing Eastern Road.<br />I'll be busy at day, but u guys can drop by after 7pm if u want a chat. :)<br /><br />I met my fellow workers today, not my boss at this moment. We'll work together this week. to be honest, I'm a bit excited and upset. :)<br /><br />The wireless of the hotel seems not to work, anyway, I'll query the information desk and try it tomorrow.<br /><br />I'm just back from WaiTan, a bit tired. I'll update my blog tomorrow if I have free time. :)
