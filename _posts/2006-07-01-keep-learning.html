It has been a long time since I posted my last blog. but I have never forget to keep learning though I don't have much time to have a rest. The day work is so busy.<br />Things changed a lot. I'll be lost if I don't keep abreast of the latest developments.<br /><br />Catalyst is divided into Catalyst::Devel and Catalyst::Runtime. Catalyst::Runtime will not require some hard-to-install dependency modules. and the new Catalyst has some new attributes like <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Runtime/lib/Catalyst/DispatchType/Chained.pm#USAGE'>PathPart('hello') Chained('/') CaptureArgs(1)</a> like. u should try Catalyst::Runtime then. :)<br /><br />DBIx::Class is updated too. I think I should learn to write a case of some new modules like <a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Object::Accessor'>Object::Accessor</a> maybe I can use it to fake a dbix-class record. Man, I need that.<br /><br />PS, mr.Jojo write a new simple httpd server based on <a href='http://poe.perl.org'>POE</a> named <a href='http://shanleiguang.googlepages.com/codes2319'>cAmel</a>. It seems nice. I want to learn POE for a long time (I planned it in the beginning of this year).<br /><br />PS2, joe will host a <a href='http://joe-jiang.livejournal.com/79681.html'>perl meeting</a> at shanghai. <a href='http://www.wanghui.org/'>cnhackTNT</a> will be there. a pity that I cann't go since I'm in Zhengzhou now. I'm planning to be back RuiAn next week.
