recently "Moose or no Moose" is spreading to the Perl world.<br /><br /><a href="http://perlhacks.com/2009/09/moose-or-no-moose.php">Moose or No Moose</a><br /><a href="http://chris.prather.org/perl/command-line-moose-or-knowing-what-you-dont-know/">Command Line Moose or Knowing what You Don't know.</a><br /><a href="http://stevan-little.blogspot.com/2009/09/re-moose-or-no-moose.html">Re: Moose Or No Moose</a><br /><a href="http://chris.prather.org/perl/take-arms-against-a-sea-of-troubles/">Take arms against a sea of troubles</a><br /><a href="http://stevan-little.blogspot.com/2009/09/re-re-moose-or-no-moose.html">Re: Re: Moose Or No Moose</a><br /><a href="http://stevan-little.blogspot.com/2009/09/moose-startup-time-over-time_02.html">Moose Startup Time over Time</a><br /><br />basically I agree with <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=49270">Adam Kennedy</a> that Array::Compare shouldn't based on Moose. Test::Warn is a popular module and Array::Compare without Moose can totally ease the install of the Test::Warn.<br /><br />in the meantime, I would agree with Stevan Little that we shouldn't hold the usage of the Moose. it's a great module with great idea and great contributors. I use it in my daily life and it works great. once more and more people/module use Moose, the problem wouldn't become a problem.<br /><br />I think Padre should use Moose, I know <A href="http://use.perl.org/~alias/journal">Adam</a> would reject that, but I insist on that Padre will benefit from Moose even Class::XSAccessor is the fastest accessor module now. Padre will be in a better structure and much more easy to read if it's coded with Moose. Plugin/Document/Highlighter would be easily written and plugged.<br /><br />another thing is that I met the problem before. Long time ago <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/WWW-Contact">people rate down</a> WWW::Contact because it uses Moose. but I think it's not true. Moose helps me to build the module.<br /><br />at last and in short, I think simple module (like only use the accessor of Moose) shouldn't use Moose but large software/module like Padre should use Moose.<br /><br />Thanks. just personal thoughts.
