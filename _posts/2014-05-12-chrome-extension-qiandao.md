It's just another chrome extension I developed in last few days. it uses content_scripts of Chrome. add hooks after visiting the related pages. and get the cookie/token to post Ajax request for signup/qiandao.

the code is available at [https://github.com/fayland/qiandao_chrome_extension](https://github.com/fayland/qiandao_chrome_extension)

访问时如果已登陆则在淘宝，百度贴吧，点评，一号店，苏宁，虾米等网站自动签到。

have fun.
