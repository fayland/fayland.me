I wrote <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Acme::PlayCode">Acme::PlayCode</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::Types::IO">MooseX::Types::IO</a> and uploaded them to CPAN today.<br /><br />Acme::PlayCode is just from:<br /><a href="http://www.fayland.org/blog/2008/10/learn-ppi-1-double-to-single.html">learn PPI 1: double to single</a><br /><a href="http://www.fayland.org/blog/2008/10/learn-ppi-2-exchange-in-condition.html">Learn PPI 2: exchange in condition</a><br />I don't think it's useful now so I put it as Acme:: for fun.<br />Acme::PlayCode use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::Object::Pluggable">MooseX::Object::Pluggable</a>, so everyone can write a plugin for it.<br />the idea is directly from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::REPL">Devel::REPL</a>. if you want to learn Moose, you should read the source. it's pretty elegant and clean. I think I'll write a plugin for it some days later.<br /><br />MooseX::Types::IO is IO and IO::All type for Moose. I thought I would use it in Acme::PlayCode so I wrote it, but I didn't use it at last. hmm. but anyway, I'll use it one day later.<br /><br />Have fun. Thanks.
