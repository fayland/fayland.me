{% include JB/setup %}

<p>We'll have a meeting @ Shanghai this weekend -- May 29th. Details @ <a href='http://wiki.perlchina.org/main/show/5%E6%9C%88asterlink%E8%B5%9E%E5%8A%A9%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7Perl%E8%81%9A%E4%BC%9A'> 5月asterlink赞助的上海Perl聚会</a><br   />
cause it's not conflict with my course&exam, I'm very glad to join the perlgeeks at Shanghai.</p>

<p>Joe want me to give a lighting talk to the attender. I seem to be adding to my grey hair.<br />
It's too difficult to determine what should be referred. I should say that I'm familiar with but not good at any topic in Perl.<br />
I know a little about such things:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://catalyst.perl.org'>Catalyst</a>, but have no idea about the plugin and member auth etc. and I think <a href='http://blog.chunzi.org'>chunzi</a> is more familar with it.
<li>How 2 tarball a module to <a href='http://search.cpan.org'>CPAN</a>. I think the guys there all know it well.
<li>Maybe Ajax. but nothing to say, it's so simple and perlish-less.
<li><a href='http://dev.perl.org/perl6/'>Perl6</a> syntax. maybe it's a good idea, but a u guys interesting in? Sigh, I'm not Larry or Damain, not the expert of Perl6.
<li><a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CGI::Application'>CGI::Application</a>, <a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Template'>Template</a>, <a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::DBI'>Class::DBI</a>, or something else. o, I'm not the author of such modules. My modules are not worth talking with.
</ul>

<p>It's 4 days left. Time is limited. </p>

<p>Of course, my another choice is to forget it. :)</p>

<p>Now what boring me most is</p>

<ul>
<li>which train should I take?
<li>When should I start to go?
<li>How can I get the Fudan University? which bus or subway station?
<li>How much will it cost?
</ul>

<p>Yap, God bless me all move smoothly.</p>
