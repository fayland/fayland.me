I'm pretty happy with scriptaculous. Ajax.Autocompleter works fine expect a bit slow than I thought.<br />so sometimes u may want that acts much faster. In that situation, I bet u can have a try of Autocompleter.Local<br /><br />Autocompleter.Local is somehow the same as Ajax.Autocompleter but the third param is an array ref instead of a remote url.<br /><br />for more details, please check:<br /><a href="http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/Autocompleter.Local">http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/Autocompleter.Local</a>
