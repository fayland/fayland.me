yap, <a href='http://rt.cpan.org'>rt.cpan.org</a> is a bug tracing system to all CPAN modules.<br>
If u are a module author, you should fix the bugs if they exist.<br>
If u are a perlmonk and find some errors when u use some module, u can report a bug on rt.cpan<p>

Today, the two situations occurred to me.<p>

I submitted a bug to Perl6-Pugs.<br>
<a href='http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=11875'>http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=11875</a><br>
It's a installation problem. when I 'svn up', and type 'perl makefile.PL', it always return:
<pre>
Can't generate the correct Perl6 equivalent for:

    C:\usr\lib

field name: archlib
osname: MSWin32

Please notify the maintainer of this code. (Brian Ingerson for now)
</pre>
another weird problem. (See <a href='050308.html'>weird thing with nmake pugs</a>)<br>
Autrijus replies:
<pre>
Hi.  It happens because C:\usr\lib did not contain "perl" in it, so
Pugs was confused.  Cc'ing ingy for discussions -- maybe just append
"perl6" to it? maybe prompt?

Thanks,
/Autrijus/
</pre>
But I think there is another reason causes my problem. forget it for now.<p>

several hours later, I got a email from 'Adam Kennedy':<Br>

I have just filed an RT bug against China::IdentityCard::Validate 
regarding it's name, which is unusual and quite out of place.

Countries to not have top level CPAN namespaces.

Must number modules like yours currently exist in the Business:: 
namespace, which you result in your module being better named.

Business::CN::IdentityCard

If I can also recommend another thing, you should consider not exporting 
the function by default, and moving to more of a hybrid style 
object/functional structure so that the module can be used very very 
flexibly, and so that you can create IdentityCard objects as well.

For an example of a _very_ similar module which wraps the same sort of 
functionality in a much more flexible "package", see

Business::AU::ABN

Feel free to copy as much of it as you wish.

It's concerning with my easy module 'China::IdentityCard::Validate'.<br>
I followed his advice, and upload new '<a href='IDCardValidate.html'>Business::CN::IdentityCard</a>' to <a href='http://pause.perl.org'>pause</a> and delete the old modules.<br>
I tried to modify my module as what he said. but I give up finally, because it's too complex to this easy module.<br>
OO-structure is just too much code to write. I don't like it. :(<br>
Maybe I'll rewrite it later.<p>

God bless me.
