It's not a busy day since I don't get into Zorpia's source code too much. My boss Jeffrey want to migrate the old Zorpia platform to Catalyst.<br />We talked something about Catalyst, especially the Model part. Since the old Zorpia source code have some SQL sentences much more complex than you thought(and we have a much much more complex database structure, which likes load balance on different servers), they doubted whether the DBIx::Class can handle them all and whether there is any speed efficiency problem. Maybe they'll use pure DBI instead, but that's not what I like. I prefer DBIx::Class, which is more cleaner, more expansive. Any way, that's not up to me. My right is to express my idea before all is nailed down.<br /><br />God bless me.
