I bought a new domain [fayland.me](http://fayland.me/).

I picked [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) as the blog engine.

I wrote a simple Perl script to convert my old MT5 blogs to Jekyll Bootstrap.

[Github code](https://github.com/fayland/p5-jekyll-scripts/blob/master/mt/migrator.pl)

the difference between this one and the [Jekyll::MT](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations) is that it supports tags and it's for [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

Have fun.
