title: ppt for PM Shanghai meeting

{% include JB/setup %}

<p>I have roughly finished my powerpoint doc for the upcoming PM meeting in Shanghai.<br />
It's related to "Perl 6 Subroutine". I want to show the attender how powerful Perl6 is.</p>

<p>Perl 6 is at hand. <a href='http://use.perl.org/~autrijus/journal/'>Autrijus</a> ship the <a href='http://www.pugscode.org'>pugs</a> in a high speed.<br />
Today he announced that we can use <a href='http://www.cpan.org'>CPAN</a> in pugs. Amazing.<br /></p>

<p>So I think the Perl6 syntax is a interesting && popular topic.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how long will it take? maybe more than 5 minites. Does it matter a lot?<br />
For my limitation of knowledge, I doubt if it's beyond my ability.<br />
It's also my virgin-show, and I doubt if I have the courage to express myself well.</p>

<p>God bless me.</p>
