after I waked up and got online this morning, I found my dreamhost is moved to another server with "unlimited bandwidth and unlimited disk". and it's new, it's 64 bit. BUT all the XS module are not usable now. I removed the perl5 dir in my /home then download local::lib and setup it, then start to re-install all my modules. OMG, it's VERY fast. I'm not sure if that's because not so many people use the new machine or the 64 bit fasten it, I'm glad with that.<br /><br />dreamhost is cheap. and I'm really happy with it. I have those sites on:<br /><a href="http://www.foorumbbs.com/">http://www.foorumbbs.com/</a> - the instance of Catalyst Foorum module.<br /><a href="http://blog.foorumbbs.com/">http://blog.foorumbbs.com/</a> - blog Foorum<br /><a href="http://docs.foorumbbs.com/">http://docs.foorumbbs.com/</a><br /><a href="http://irclog.foorumbbs.com/?C=M;O=D">http://irclog.foorumbbs.com/?C=M;O=D</a> - irc log<br /><a href="http://planet.foorumbbs.com/">http://planet.foorumbbs.com/</a> - Planet Perlchina, used by <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/CNPerlPlanet">http://feeds.feedburner.com/CNPerlPlanet</a>, subscribe it!<br /><br />another thing, my first credit card from <a href="http://www.cmbchina.com/">http://www.cmbchina.com/</a> got expired today. I use it to buy my dreamhost and buy things online. I love it indeed.<br /><br />Thanks.
