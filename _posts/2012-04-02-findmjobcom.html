{% include JB/setup %}

maybe to earn some money (not for fun this time), I decided to write a new website <a href="http://findmjob.com/">http://findmjob.com/</a><div><br /></div><div>I sit front of my computer and coded it for 2 days and here is it. it's out.<br /><div><br /></div><div>it's very simple and without much stuff yet. and the final goal is undecided. but there it is. I'm very pleased to see it in public.</div><div><br /></div><div>since there is no reason to keep it private, I opened source it in github:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/fayland/findmjob.com">https://github.com/fayland/findmjob.com</a></div><div><br /></div><div>for programmer, it's very simple to write website. but it's very hard to make it a success. so suggestions are welcome.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks.</div>
