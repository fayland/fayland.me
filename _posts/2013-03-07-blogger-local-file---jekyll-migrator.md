I have an [old Blogger](http://fayland.org/blog/) before I move to MT5, it contains my posts from 2006 to 2009. some are quite old, broken, useless and even not worth reading. but some are still very useful and it's a part of my memory and life. (Sorry that comments are dropped that I can't import it into Disqus.)

so I wrote a simple Perl script to convert the local HTML files into Jekyll here. the source code can be found in [github](https://github.com/fayland/p5-jekyll-scripts/blob/master/blogger/migrator.pl).

it's quite simple and maybe just fit for my need. but feel free to change it if you have same demand.

Have fun.
