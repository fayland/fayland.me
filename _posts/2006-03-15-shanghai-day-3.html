ok, guys. At last, we decided to use DBIx::Class as our model. We planned to migrate to Catalyst within the coming month. I'll share my experience with you in the migration process. Of course, I'll not tell you anything related to the source code, which is not  allowed. Yup, I'll be busy in the coming month, which is what I want. ;-)<br /><br />cnhackTNT told me that he'll come to Perl Conf/BeiJing at 25th this month, yet I'm still not sure. I wish I could go. I bet I'll go if the work is going smoothly in the next week.<br /><br />God bless me.
