Thank God, I passed the CET 6(College English Test 6).<br>
I'll celebrate this with beer and foods this evening together with my schoolmates, and it's a pity that most of them failed. What's more pity, I'm still coughing badly (more than a month now) and cann't have any beer.<p>

To some extent, I should owe my success to perl. The perl infomation is almost wrote in English, I surf the English site, read articles, and translate them into Chinese. These helps me a lot.<p>

Several days ago, I decided to have further education -- be a graduate student. My dear sister told me that the graduate English exam is more difficult than CET 6, so I need more efforts.<br>
Writing some essays somtimes, just like what I'm doing now, is a step. Translating more perl works is another.<p>

Thank God, everyday has surprise.
