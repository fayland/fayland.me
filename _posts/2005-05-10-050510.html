Finally I'm back from ZhengZhou. It's a happy time there with my dear girl friend.<p>

Now I'm the maintainer of <a href='http://china.pm.org'>China.pm</a> instead of tsingson. But I'm not sure what sure be added in this site. The primary reason of requesting this <a href='http://www.pm.org'>pm</a> is to get the <a href='http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/china-pm'>maillist</a>. It's a great maillist powered by mailman, but we still have some encoding error.<p>

The first idea in my brain is to build a meeting announcement system. It fits the meaning of pm.org(Perl Mongers). Sadly the pm.org doesn't provide any cgi privilege and it's hard to maintain by hand.<br>
The next idea is to build a city/location contact-list, so the perl monger in the same city can have more talk and meetings. with the same reason, I give up.<p>

Qiang said we shouldn't pay our attention on pm.org, <a href='http://www.perlchina.org'>PerlChina.org</a> is enough. That makes sense.<br>
Any one has any idea?
