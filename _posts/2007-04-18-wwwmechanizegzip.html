well, for some web like mail.yahoo.com, it compressed using gzip.<br />so when we get the page content by WWW::Mechianize, it may return some content with gziped.<br /><br />so I would suggest to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::Mechanize::GZip">WWW::Mechanize::GZip</a>. it handles gzip pretty well.<br /><br />have fun.
